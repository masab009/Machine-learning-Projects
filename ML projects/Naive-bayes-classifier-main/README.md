# ML-projects
This is NLP classifier which classifies a string (an expense) into its following categories based on the naive bayes algorithm
1. Administrative expenses
2. distribution costs
3. finance cost

The model tokenizes, preprocesses and performs computations on the dataset which is synthetic and generated from LLMs such as GPT 4 and Gemini advanced. The real world application might be slightly different but it implies the idea that how financial statements preparation can be automated using ML models.
